           <h1>How to make Chicken Noodle Soup</h1>
           <h2 style="color:green">Why these ingredients?</h2>
            <p> -Onions and Celery: In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.</p>
            <p> -Broth: This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</p>
            <p> -Chicken: Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</p>
            <p> -Noodles: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</p>
            <p> -Carrots: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</p>
            <p> -Basil and Oregano: Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</p>

                    <h1>Historical Context</h1>
                    <p>Chicken soup arrived in America as early as the 16th century thanks to <br>European immigrants, mainly Jews, Mennonites and Amish. The latter <br> made an all-American combination by adding dry and fresh corn they<br> adopted from Native Americans.</p>
